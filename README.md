In today's modern web of clickable links, bookmarks, and QR codes, when was the last time you actually typed in a url into your browser? Many people urge against using really long domain names, but I disagree, so long as you appear on Google, people will find your site that way, regardless of how long your domain name is.

Longer domain names allow you to be more descriptive, and reel in a wider audience. How much can a user really tell about your website by just looking at the domain name? Probably not much.

Let's take an actual use case where I supported a local business by "upgrading" their domains to a more descriptive and "user-friendly" domain. They started with the paltry and not so descriptive domain name of [**MedTechSweden.com**](http://medtechsweden.com/).

After I was done with them, their domain name did all the talking for them, so their website didn't have to:

<li class="flink" style="background-image: url(http://medtechsweden.com/favicon.ico);"><a href="http://A.company.that.manufactures.medical.products.such.as.vacuum.spine.boards.and.vacuum.extremity.splints.used.by.EMTs.and.rescue.personnel.Our.business.name.is.MedTechSweden.com">A.company.that.manufactures.medical.products.such.as.vacuum.spine.boards.and.vacuum.extremity.splints.used.by.EMTs.and.rescue.personnel.Our.business.name.is.MedTechSweden.com</a></li>

Even my own personal website, [**IQAndreas.com**](http://www.iqandreas.com/), can instead be reached via the following, more descriptive domain: 

<li class="flink iqandreas_com"><a href="http://I.am.a.programmer.with.multiple.programming.languages.under.my.belt.but.im.usually.more.interested.in.learning.them.and.arguing.about.them.than.actually.coding.in.them.Known.on.the.internet.as.IQAndreas.com/">I.am.a.programmer.with.multiple.programming.languages.under.my.belt.but.im.usually.more.interested.in.learning.them.and.arguing.about.them.than.actually.coding.in.them.Known.on.the.internet.as.IQAndreas.com</a></li>

### Is there actually a limit?

Yes, sadly, there is a limit.

According to [the Wikipedia entry on the _Domain Name System_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Domain_name_syntax):

> Each label may contain up to 63 characters. The full domain name may not exceed the length of 253 characters in its textual representation.

However, so long as you stay below that hard limit arbitrarily set by the higher-ups, you can go nuts and create as long of a subdomain (or more accurately, as many labels) as needed to appropriately describe your website to the end user.

### What about the extra 'www.www'?

That is an ode to [www.www.extra-www.org](http://www.www.extra-www.org/), an organization determined to keep the `www` part of domains alive by urging site owners and web developers to add an extra `www` to the beginning of their site to compensate for threats such as [no-ww.org](http://no-www.org/).
